    "The objective of this exercise is to apply what we have learned in the last three weeks. That is to familiarize yourself with fundamental data science techniques, including data cleaning and exploration. Afterwards, you will apply Linear Regression, build a model for prediction, and tune the model using cost function and gradient descent. Finally, as a bonus, you will have the opportunity to explore and learn by yourself geographic libraries that were not covered in the exercise."

    "## Coding standard points to follow for obtaining the bonus\n",
    "1. **General formatting**: In general try to apply a unified coding style, you can adopt **PEP 8** Recommendations. Pep 8 is a well known python style, or you can come up with your own style just stay consistent with the following bulletins\n",
    "2. **Variable names**: PEP 8 Style (or your own style): function names: **'snake_case'**, constant: **'ALL_UPPERCASE'**, variables: **'descriptive_snake_case'**\n",
    "3. **Comments**:  Add comments above your code that add meaning. Think what would you write if you would come back to the code in one month and you don't have time to review all the code.\n",
    "4. **DocString**: Add description to the methods you write, this is different than writing a code, because docString can appear as code hints in your IDE program. I recommend to adapt the [numpy](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html) codestring standard\n",
    "5. **Spacing and blank lines**: These tips are more general to make your code look preattier. Try to seperate logical parts of the code withe blank lines, try to add spaces within the line so the code won't loook to densed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general for each of thses points you can ask ChatGPT to help you with your coding style or to just rewrite the code"
